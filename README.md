## Project Description
GopherGrub is a web application that allows users to rate and review various dining halls on a university campus. The application takes user ratings to provide an average rating for each dining hall, helping students and staff make informed dining decisions. Users can also view and leave comments on specific dining halls, making it a community-driven platform for dining feedback.

Backend Development: 
Server Setup with Node.js and Express: Developed the backend using Node.js and Express.

LowDB Integration: Integrated LowDB to store ratings and comments. Ensured that the database is initialized with default data, avoiding errors when the application is first run.
